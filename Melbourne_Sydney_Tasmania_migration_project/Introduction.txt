Melbourne and Sydney are the two biggest cities in Australia and housing affordability and congestion is increasing in both cities (although Sydney is significantly greater).
Although once considered as one of the retirement villages of Australia, the recent demographic data suggests that there is a large population of younger groups, including young families, migrating to Tasmania (“hello Tassie!”).
Housing affordability, traffic and other forms of congestion that affect lifestyle and amenity are often cited as the reasons for leaving Melbourne and Sydney.
